    <b><p><font text="Merriweather">‘How to meditate, increase mindfulness & find God’ is not my Blog or writing. My intellect is too small to even begin to answer this most profound question like the saints who walked this country did. They gave to this world the real meaning of spirituality and the precise understanding of mindfulness, who is God and how to find God through meditation. This blog is their message, their words, their writing. I feel immensely blessed to be their very small instrument as I amplify their message further. This blog is also my very personal spiritual story: the story of my learning on the most beautiful road of spirituality (Not religion).</p></font></b>

    <h2><a href="https://akashgautam.com/2018/03/22/how-to-study-for-long-hours-with-concentration/">How to Study for Long Hours with Concentration?</h2></a>
    <p><b>Any mention of studying & what makes a good student would be incomplete without this Sanskrit shloka. It means – the five most important qualities that any sincere student needs to possess are: perseverance like a crow (never gives up), concentration of a heron (who catches fish like no one else does), sleeps like a dog (always alert), does not over-eat and does not socialize like a house on fire. It’s a very brief summary of this entire blog post on how to study for long hours with Concentration.</p></b>
